        <h2>My background</h2>
        <p>
          I pursued a <strong>University Bachelor's Degree in Networks and Telecommunications</strong> at the IUT of Blagnac from 2022 to 2025.
This program provided me with solid skills in<strong>computer networking, cybersecurity, Linux/Windows systems, telecommunications, and virtualization</strong>. 
         It also gave me a strong technical foundation combined with professional discipline, thanks to the work-study format.
        </p>

        <h2>My Professional Experience</h2>
        <p>
          During my two years of work-study, I worked within the<strong>Yobbo Ventures group</strong>, which comprises three complementary companies:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Soy Club</strong> – As a network administrator, I was responsible for supervising field interventions, designing network architectures tailored to client needs, overseeing projects from A to Z, and coordinating with all stakeholders. This position taught me operational management, attention to detail, and client relations.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Un1ty</strong> –– I participated in configuring IP telephony solutions for businesses, creating POCs for telecom equipment, and setting up architectures that enabled the company to become a telecom operator.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Gladiatek</strong>  – I configured hybrid backup solutions (local NAS + cloud backup + blockchain replication). This experience deepened my skills in data security and continuity.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          I also contributed to a 4-month marketing and <strong>cryptocurrency</strong> development project for Soy Club: writing the white paper, designing the smart contract, developing the communication strategy, handling press relations, etc. A unique experience blending technical knowledge, strategic thinking, and communication.
        </p>

        <h2>My Objectives</h2>
        <p>
          In the short term, I am looking for a  <strong>work-study position in cybersecurity or systems/network administration</strong> within a larger organization. My goal is to discover more structured environments, benefit from better technical resources, and engage in high-impact projects.
In the long term, I aim to grow into roles such as <strong>cybersecurity project manager</strong>, <strong>security expert</strong>, or  <strong>technical team leader</strong>.
        </p>

       <h2>My Personality</h2>
<p>
  I am a <strong>versatile</strong>, <strong>sociable</strong>, and <strong>punctual</strong> person with <strong>excellent communication</strong> skills.  
  My experience in a multi-company environment has taught me to juggle multiple roles, prioritize tasks, handle unexpected situations, and collaborate with all kinds of stakeholders.
</p>

<h2>Passions & Certifications</h2>
<p>
  Passionate about <strong>pentesting</strong>, <strong>chess</strong>, and <strong>scuba diving</strong>, I nurture curiosity and analytical thinking both in my personal and professional life.  
  I have obtained several technical certifications, including:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>3CX Advanced</li>
  <li>Palo Alto</li>
  <li>Stormshield</li>
  <li>ANSSI MOOC</li>
  <li>CCNA 1</li>
  <li>Zyxel</li>
</ul>

<p>
  I am also interested in the fields of <strong>finance and real estate</strong>, in which I lead personal projects.
